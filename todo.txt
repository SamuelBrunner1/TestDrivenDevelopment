Install testing framework (e.g., Jasmine).
Create Initial Files

Create src/electrons.js for the main logic.
Create spec/electronsSpec.js for the tests.
Write Test Cases for Known Inputs

Write a test for input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] expecting output 6.
Write a test for input [2, 2, 3, 3] expecting output 4.
Write a test for input [6, 6, 4, 4, 1, 3] expecting output 2.
Write a test for input [3, 5, 3, 5, 4, 2] expecting output 12.
Implement Production Code

Implement the simplest logic to pass the first test case.
Gradually add logic to handle all the test cases.
Refactor and Optimize

Refactor the production code for readability and performance.
Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring.
Additional Test Cases

Add more test cases to cover edge cases and other possible inputs.
Ensure all test cases pass.
